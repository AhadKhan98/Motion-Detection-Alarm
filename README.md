# Motion Detection Alarm
### Author: Ahad Zai
## Functionality
This program monitors motion using the user's webcam. Depending on the sensitivity (which can be set) the program sounds an alarm and displays a message when a certain amount of motion is detected. After closing the program, an html file is generated which contains a graph of the times the object entered the frame and left. 

## Instructions
1) Download and run the script. (main.py)
2) Enter how sensitive you want the detection to be. (1=Low, 2=Med, 3=High)
3) A window with the view from your webcam will be displayed.
4) When motion is detected, a message box will appear indicating that. 
5) Press 'q' to exit the program.
6) A new file will be created 'Graph.html' which contains a graph of the times the object entered and exited the frame.
